  <p>Hi everyone, I'm David Bonoso, and I don't have any nickname. I live in San Rafael, Mendoza Argentina. This is a really
  good place, close to my house there is a valley and I love to go to get fresh air. One of my hobbies is playing chess
  with my friends and I like to read books about the gospel, now I'm reading the History of the Church by Joseph Smith.
  Almost I forget, I love to drink mate :)
  I'm studying Web and computer development.
  Then, I have 2 sisters and they live in California, USA. And I live with my mom and my brother Jhon, He has 17 years old
  and is preparing to go on the mission.</p>
